This repository contains the results from ConMax3D: "Frame
Selection for 3D Reconstruction through Concept
Maximization". The folder reconstruction_videos contains the reconstructions using the test images (i.e., the images which were not selected by the frame selection algorithm). The plots folder contains the comparison of different methods for the metrics used in the paper.
